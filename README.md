## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp

### What I learned

- How to use Gulp to create tasks to compile Sass to css.
- How to split the SASS file into small files and load them where needed.

```css
@use "colors";
@use "base";
```

### Continued development

I will continue learning CSS responsive design alongside SASS.
